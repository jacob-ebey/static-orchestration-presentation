# Agenda

- What is Webpack 5 Module Federation?

- How dynamic module loading works

- What this looks like in use today

- Towards the future!
  - Node.js import streaming
  - Dynamic hosts
  - Production HMR and Static Orchestration

# What is Webpack 5 Module Federation?

Multiple separate builds should form a single application.

These separate builds should not have dependencies between each other,
so they can be developed and deployed individually.

This is often known as Micro-Frontends, but is not limited to that.

---

## Module Federation building blocks

  - ContainerPlugin
    - Creates an aditional entry point in the build output
    - Uses OverridablesPlugin internally

  - ContainerReferencePlugin
    - Allows you to import remote modules
    - Calls the overridables API

  - ModuleFederationPlugin
    - Combines ContainerPlugin and ContainerReferencePlugin
    - Simply a convenience layer

---

# How dynamic module loading works

- Promise based

- Target dependent
  - `web` jsonp (script tag injection)
  - `node` combination of require.cache and file system reads

import webImportFlow from './images/web-import.svg';

## `import` in browser land

<img src={webImportFlow} />

<br />

---

import nodeImportFlow from './images/node-import.svg';

## `import` in Node.js

<img src={nodeImportFlow} />

<br />

---

# How this is used today

- Code Splitting and lazy loading in the browser

  - Reduce initial payload transfer

  - Dynamically select a component for render

---

import remoteEntry from './images/remote-entry.png';

<SplitRight>

  <img src={remoteEntry} style={{ padding: '2rem' }} />

  ## Useage in Module Federation

  - Each host in webpack creates a secondary entry file on build

  - Entry is essentially a mapping of it exposes modules

  - Each module that host exposes is dynamically imported when requested

</SplitRight>

import moduleFederation from './images/module-federation-plugin.png';

<SplitRight>

  <img src={moduleFederation} style={{ padding: '2rem' }} />

  # Towards the future

  Stream your `import`'s from remote file systems

  Dynamic hosts

  Production HMR

  Static Orchestration

</SplitRight>

import dashboard from './images/dashboard.jpg';

import federatedGraph from './images/federated-graph.svg';

<Split>

  <img src={federatedGraph} style={{ height: '100%', width: 'auto' }} />

  # lululemon's graph

  Apollo Federation without the network latancy

  Orchestrated with Webpack 5 Module Federation

  Immutable modules between gateway deploys
